!!! Installation (for whose who already have Web Server)
MedusWiki is CGI program, so you can run it on any web server that supports CGI and has python interpreter.

Set ''read/write'' premissions for /data directory (unix: chmod -R 777 data). It's recommended to move /data directory to some place that is not webvisible. This directory must be written in the ''index.py'' file:
 cfg['data_path'] = '/path/to/data'
Set ''execute'' permission for the main file. (unix: chmod 755 index.py).

In case your Web Server requires specific extension for cgi scripts, rename  ''index.py'' to ''index.cgi'' or some other.
