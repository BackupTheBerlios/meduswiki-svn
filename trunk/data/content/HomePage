!! What is MedusWiki?
MedusWiki is a Python Wiki engine intended to be used as a personal knowledge management system. It uses Topic Maps (XTM) to store associations between wiki pages. Old file-and-folder-oriented mentality is discarded and content objects are located using their metadata only. Personally, I am using it to store bookmarks, manage todo list, write notes and documentation.

!!! More details, please!
* CGI program;
* independent of platform;
* data storage - file system;
* metadata storage - ''topic map''  ([http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/|XTM]);
* ZPT (TAL) templates.
